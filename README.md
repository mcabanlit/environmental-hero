## Environmental Studies Projects [![gcash donation][1]][2] [![paypal donation][3]][4]

This is a collection of a portion of some environmental projects that I have worked on. Unfortunately only a few of the working files have been recovered and most of the remaining files that can be accessed are presentation files only. However, if you would like to discuss methodologies and recreating the project, please do not hesitate to send me an [email](mailto:john@example.com).


### Are Mangroves in Mactan Island at Risk
This project aims to aid in the assessment of at risk areas of mangrove forests in Mactan Island. The proposed indicators might be limited due to financial and time constraints of the project, however the replicability of the presented method should still accomodate if a new variable/criterion is introduced.

### Extracting Abandoned Brackish Water Fishpond for Mangrove Reversion
With the need to increase sources of food and increase productivity of aquaculture, a considerable mass of mangroves in the Philippines and in other parts of the world have been converted into brackish water ponds. This study aims to help in the identification of abandoned brackish water ponds for mangrove reversion using LiDAR data. The location where there are extracted abandoned fishponds may be considered as candidates for mangrove reversion.

### Improving River Navigation Systems While Preserving Oyster Farms
Rivers may be used for both navigation and aquaculture. With this twin yet conflicting services provided by the river, a science-based management approach is necessary in order to protect and regulate the riverâ€™s use. The Hinigaran River of Negros Occidental Western Philippines is home to various aquaculture facilities, ranging from very large fish pens to small structures such as oyster culture-stakes. The main objective of this study was to delineate the suitable area for aquaculture along the river and identify the optimal navigation route without jeopardizing culture operations.

### Modelling the Economic Growth using SVM and ARIMA
Through support vector machine, we were able to create a reasonable model of forecasting the Growth Domestic Product of the Philippines from 2018 to 2030. The ARIMA models for the time series forecasting values for our import and export data GDP projection was also helpful in determining the pattern of the prediction in our SVM model.

### Nearshore Fisheries Zoning Analysis in the Negros Island Region
The first part of this study was the extraction of the nearshore fish corrals In Negros Occidental using Object Based Image Analysis. A weighted overlay analysis was then applied to the different rasters in order to arrive at a suitability raster.

### Neural Networks in Optimizing Vulnerability Indicators Towards Climate Change (Proposal)
The related studies on large-scale vulnerability studies in mangrove resources have shown that there is incoherence regarding the various approaches in analyzing vulnerability. Through the help of geographic information systems in policy making and the advancement and increased application of AI in ecological modeling has provided new ways in assessing relative vulnerability of ecological resources.

### Oyster Culture Issues and Site Suitability Analysis (Proposal)
This proposal is a revival of the river navigation research along Hinigaran river. Hopefully in this proposal we get to dig deeper into both the ecological and anthropological aspects of the issue.

### Restoring the Big River (Restoration Plan for Sapandaku River)
River restoration is the reestablishment of natural physical processes, feature and physical habitats of a river system. Due to the extent of the damages caused by sand and grave extraction, construction of structures and other urban developments, the whole restoration project is subdivided into 5 different phases of action.
